Implementation of "Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders" paper in Theano and Lasagne. This implementation does not have the gated connection and is built to synthesis 32x32 RGB images, which are expected as the input of this network. However, the learning process is very slow and requires extremely high computational power to synthesize good quality images. A part of this code is inspired from Kundan Kumar's work.

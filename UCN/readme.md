Implementation of the paper "Universal Correspondence Network"[1] using Theano and Lasagne. Unfortunately, I was not able to train this network extensively as the time when I implemented this paper, I did not have an access to the GPU. Hence, the hyperparameters provided in this implementation has to be optimized and the training has to be implemented making a call to the `train_function`. For convolutional Spatial transformer, refer to `patchwise_st` method.
